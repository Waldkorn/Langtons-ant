# Langtons ant

Langton's ant walks over a board and changes the color of every square it touches. If it steps on a white square it turns left, if it steps on a black square it turns right. 

Langton's ant initially moves chaotically but after 10.000 steps a pattern emerges and Langton's ant walks off the board.
